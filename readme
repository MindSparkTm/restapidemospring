This is the instructions of how to use the application 

The application has been built using Java with Spring boot,JPA, Hibernate, Maven and Mysql Database.

The IDE that has been used is IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition.


The architecture that has been used to build this REST API is as follows

                               ----Controller  ------
                                      |
                                      V
                              ----- Service Layer --------
                                      |
                                      V
                             ------- Data Access Layer--------
                                      |
                                      V
                            -------  Mysql Database----------------



Instructions on how to use the application:-

Database layer -
1. To set up the database script a bankaccount.sql script is added in the project directory.
2. You can use Xammp to import the script and set up the tables with data.
3. The account number that has been configured with the application is 1111.
4. Execute the bankaccount.sql script in Xammp Control Panel and it will set up the sql database.

IntelliJ IDE database configuration:-=
1. Navigate to the application.properties and edit the following to connect to the Database

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/SampleAccount
